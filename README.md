# Word-meaning-finder
It's a program in Python that will find the meaning of a word using the dictionary module. This module is not part of the standard library, so you will need to install it using pip:

<p style="color:#808080"><i>pip install dictionary</i></p> </br>
Once you have installed the dictionary module, you can use it to find the meaning of a word.

This program will prompt the user to enter a word, and then it will use the dictionary module to find the meaning of the word. It will then print the meaning to the console.
