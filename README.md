# Word-meaning-finder
It's a program in Python that will find the meaning of a word using the dictionary module. This module is not part of the standard library, so you will need to install it using pip:
```
$ pip install dictionary
```
<i>Once you have installed the dictionary module, you can use it to find the meaning of a word</i>

This program will prompt the user to enter a word, and then it will use the dictionary module to find the meaning of the word. It will then print the meaning to the console.
