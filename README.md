# Word-meaning-finder
This program uses the requests library to make a request to the dictionary.com website for the given word and uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the response and extract the definition of the word.

To use this program, you need to first install the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries. You can do this by running the following command:
```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```
You can then run the program by providing the word you want to find the definition of as a command line argument.
