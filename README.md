# Word-meaning-finder
This program uses the requests library to make a request to the <i>dictionary.com</i> website for the given word and uses the <strong>BeautifulSoup</strong> library to parse the response and extract the definition of the word.

To use this program, you need to first install the <b>requests</b> and <b>beautifulsoup4</b>libraries. You can do this by running the following command:
```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```
You can then run the program by providing the word you want to find the definition of as a command line argument.
